                            Sometimes I feel alone and my problems don't matter. It's easy for people to say they care but why do I always feel like my problems will never end and there is no light at the end of this tunnel.

                            So I created this thread to see if anyone wants to work on creating an N Wheeled class vehicle with me, as opposed to a bunch of people banging their heads against the wall seperately.
